# chatbot
CODE:
Step 1: Data Preprocessing

The first step in building our chatbot is to preprocess the text data. We start by reading the text data from a file (python.txt in this case) and converting it to lowercase. We also tokenize the text into sentences and words using the NLTK library.

Token normalization involves removing any unnecessary characters, punctuation, and special symbols from words and converting all words to lowercase. Stemming is the reduction of inflection in words. Words with the same origin will get reduced to a form that may or may not be a word.

Step 2: Lemmatization and Token Normalization

Next, we perform lemmatization and token normalization to reduce words to their base form and remove punctuation from the text. This process helps standardize the words and reduce the size of the vocabulary.

Lemmatization is the process of reducing a word to its base or root form.

Step 3: Building the Chatbot

Now that we have preprocessed the text data, we can start building our chatbot. Our chatbot will respond to user input based on the similarity between the user input and the sentences in the text data. We use the TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity to determine the similarity between sentences by installing the sklearn-features module.

Step 4: Creating the User Interaction Loop

Finally, we create a loop that allows the user to interact with the chatbot. The chatbot responds to user input and can greet the user. It can also handle queries and provide relevant responses. The loop continues until the user enters ‘bye’ to exit the chat.

That’s pretty much all.
Happy Coding!
